# Flutter Project

## Brief Description  
an innovative mobile app tackling muscle imbalances in bodybuilding! üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Leveraging Deep Learning Algorithms, our system uses CNN and TensorFlow models to not only identify imbalances but also offers tailored exercise recommendations. Achieving a robust 97.3% testing accuracy, the app is designed for image-based results with future plans to incorporate live video analysis, and real time excercise tracking is in progress.
